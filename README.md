ABC-MDGP
========

For a school assignment, we implemented an Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for solving the Maximally Diverse Grouping Problem in Java.

We implemented the ABC approach explained in "An artificial bee colony algorithm for the maximally diverse grouping problem" from Francisco J. Rodriguez, M. Lozano, C. Garcia-Martinez and Jonathan D. Gonzalez-Barrera in Information Science.

We used the framework created by the [Optiscom Project](http://www.optsicom.es/mdgp/). This library is not open source, so we could only use the binary Java archive provided on their website.

We do not guarantee that the implementation is completelly correct or that it is efficient is it would be correct.
